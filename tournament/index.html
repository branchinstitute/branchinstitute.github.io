    <p>Hello all! I would like to invite you to the Branch Tournament on May 9th and 10th. It will be online on Discord with a focus on making sure that there are not audio issues. There will be Open and Novice divisions for PF, LD, and Policy. Visit our website at https://branchinstitute.tk/tournament/ for more details. They can be found there and on our Discord server (invite on website). Tabroom registration will be open soon and I will update this post then. Most updates will still be on the Discord server. Feel free to reply here and ask questions.</p>
