      Hello all! I would like to invite you to the Branch Tournament on May 9th and 10th. It will be online on Discord with a focus on making sure that there are not audio issues. <br> There will be Open and Novice divisions for PF, LD, and Policy. Visit our website at https://branchinstitute.tk/tournament/ for more details. <br> They can be found there and on our Discord server (invite on website). Tabroom registration will be open soon. <br> Most updates will still be on the Discord server.
